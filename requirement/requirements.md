# Objective
Build a RESTful API for a Simple Q&A Forum application that helps users ask questions and participate in discussions. This system requires authentication and must ensure that users are only authorized to update or delete the threads (questions) they created themselves.

# Required Features
User Management: Registration, login (generating a token/session), and viewing profiles.
CRUD Threads: Create, Read, Update, and Delete discussion threads.
Validation & Error Handling: Handle empty inputs, invalid email formats, or unauthorized access by returning the appropriate HTTP Status Codes (400, 401, 403, 404, 500).
Database Relations: Implement a one-to-many relationship between users and threads (One user can create multiple threads).

# Requirements
Language/Framework: Node.js (Express/NestJS), Go, Python, or PHP (Choose the one you are currently focusing on).
Database: PostgreSQL, MySQL, or SQLite (recommended for an easy local setup).
Additional: You must use Environment Variables (.env) to store configurations such as the port, database credentials, and JWT Secret.

# Deliverables
1. Source Code: Submit a link to your public GitHub repository containing the complete source code.
2. API Documentation (Screenshots): Include detailed screenshots of your Swagger UI (or OpenAPI documentation) for each endpoint. The screenshots must clearly demonstrate:
	- The endpoint URL and HTTP Method.
	- Required request bodies, headers, or parameters.
	- Expected responses for both success (e.g., 200, 201) and error states (e.g., 400, 401, 404).
